Creating an integration with Nanobox can be done entirely outside of Nanobox. In fact, the entire integration will live outside of Nanobox. Essentially, a provider integration is just an API endpoint that standardizes the interaction between Nanobox and a cloud provider, acting as a bridge or proxy to facilitate communication between the the two.

The integration can be written in any language and run anywhere. As long as the API conforms to the specification as detailed here, the endpoint can be added into Nanobox and users can launch apps on your provider.

## General Requirements

There are only a few requirements that a provider must satisfy in order to integrate with Nanobox:

1.  Must implement the API spec as outlined here.

2.  Must be able to launch servers running a base Ubuntu OS (12.04+).

3.  The user specified for SSH access (see `ssh_user`, below) must either be `root`, or have access to run commands as `root` via passwordless `sudo`, so that Nanobox can bootstrap the server effectively.

4.  Servers with only one NIC must be reported as having an internal interface, but no external one, regardless of which IP address is assigned to the interface itself. Nanobox uses the internal interface to build a virtual network (layer 2/3 vxlan) for each app. NICs can be hardware-backed or virtual as long as the OS is able to see them.

5.  Avoid using the `192.168.0.0/24` network space on the host, as Nanobox uses these addresses for its vxlan.

6.  Servers must have at least of 128MB of RAM, but the recommended minimum is 512MB. Nanobox [platform components](/live-app-management/platform-components/) require approximately 50MB of RAM.

7.  Both virtual machines and bare metal machines work, as long as the OS isn't sharing a kernel (the host can't be a Docker or LXC container).

## API

### OpenAPI Specification

The API documented below is also formalized in [an OpenAPI spec](openapi-spec.json) which you can develop and test against. There are some things to keep in mind if you decide to use it:

1.  *This document* is the authoritative source. If the spec file disagrees with anything below, the *spec file* is out of date. Please [let us know](https://github.com/nanobox-io/nanobox-docs/issues) if you find any inconsistencies!

2.  Since an adapter is an API, the spec file was designed so you can host it alongside the adapter itself, as a reference for your specific implementation. This means some parts of the spec file should be updated to reflect your own implementation:

    1.  The `info` block. Update everything in this section to match your adapter's actual values for each property.

    2.  The `basePath` should contain your adapter's URI, relative to the server root.

    3.  If your adapter will not or cannot support storing SSH keys globally, you can remove the `/keys` and `/keys/{id}` entries from the `paths` collection. Be sure to return `object` for the `ssh_key_method` value, below, or return `password` for `ssh_auth_method` and implement the Install Server Key endpoint.

    4.  If the default [credential field](#meta) (`Auth-Token`) doesn't suit your adapter's needs (you want to use a different name, you have more than one field, etc), update the `securityDefinitions` section, using `securityDefinitions["Auth-Token"]` as a base. If you have more than one credential field, be sure to also add the new field references to the object in `security[0]` - for example:
        ```json
        "security": [
            {
                "Auth-Token": [],
                "Auth-Key": []
            }
        ],
        ```
        Note that these header values must start with `Auth-`, but the `credential_fields` value below should return keys *without* the prefix.

    5.  Validate your changes using a tool such as the [online Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/) (use File â†’ Import File... to upload your spec file) before you publish and/or develop/test against it.

##### Gathering Metadata
The `/meta` route provides Nanobox with various pieces of metadata that are used for displaying information in the dashboard and for requesting authentication information from users.

###### Path:
`/meta`

###### Method:
GET

###### Headers:
none

###### Body:
empty

###### Response:
*   `id`: some unique identifier
*   `name`: display name used in the dashboard
*   `server_nick_name`: what this provider calls their servers
*   `default_region`: the default region to launch servers when not specified
*   `default_size`: default server size to use when creating an app
*   `default_plan`: the [id of the default plan](#catalog) in which the default size is ordered
*   `can_reboot`: boolean to determine if we can reboot the server through the api
*   `can_rename`: boolean to determine if we can rename the server through the api
*   `internal_iface`: Internal interface. e.g. `eth1`
*   `external_iface`: External interface. e.g. `eth0`
*   `ssh_user`: The ssh user Nanobox can use for ssh access to bootstrap the server. e.g. `root`
*   `ssh_auth_method`: `key` or `password`. When set to "key", Nanobox will behave in accordance with the `ssh_key_method` value. When set to "password", Nanobox will use the Install Server Key endpoint to install the SSH key manually via the adapter, instead of passing it in the create server step.
*   `ssh_key_method`: `reference` or `object`. When set to "reference", Nanobox will first create the SSH key in the user's provider account, then pass a reference to it when servers are created. When set to "object", Nanobox will pass the actual public SSH key that should be installed on the server.
*   `bootstrap_script`: The script that should be used to boostrap the server. e.g. `https://s3.amazonaws.com/tools.nanobox.io/bootstrap/ubuntu.sh`
*   `credential_fields`: array of hashes that includes field keys and labels necessary to authenticate with the provider.
*   `config_fields`: array of hashes that includes field keys and labels necessary to configure provider-specific features for a server, and flags indicating whether or not each setting requires a server to be rebuilt in order to update its value.
*   `instructions`: string that contains instructions for how to setup authentication with the provider.

Example using the Digital Ocean adapter:

```json
{
  "id":                "do",
  "name":              "Digital Ocean",
  "server_nick_name":  "Droplet",
  "default_region":    "sfo1",
  "default_size":      "512mb",
  "default_plan":      "standard",
  "can_reboot":        true,

##### Requesting the Catalog
The `/catalog` route provides Nanobox with a catalog of server sizes and options, within the available geographic regions.

###### Path:
`/catalog`

###### Method:
GET

###### Headers:
none

###### Body:
empty

###### Response:
The response data should be a list (array) of regions. Each region should contain a list of plans. It is not necessary to have multiple regions, however the structure is the same regardless. Additionally, your integration may only have one classification of server types, or you may have high-cpu, high-ram, or high-IO options. A plan is a grouping of server sizes within a classification.

**Note:** *For multiple regions with with identical plans/server-sizes, plans/server-sizes must be duplicated for each region.*

Each region in the catalog consists of the following:

*   `id`: unique region identifier to be used when ordering a server.
*   `name`: the visual identifier for the customer.
*   `plans`: A grouping of server sizes within a classification. Each plan consists of the following:

    *   `id`: unique plan identifier.
    *   `name`: the classification of the server options within this plan.  The name should indicate to the user what kinds of workloads these server options are ideal for. For instance: "Standard" or "High CPU".
    *   `specs`: the list of server options within this plan. Each spec should have the following fields:

        *   `id`: a unique identifier that will be used when ordering a server
        *   `ram`: a visual indication to the user informing the amount of RAM is provided.
        *   `cpu`: a visual indication to the user informing the amount of CPUs or CPU cores.
        *   `disk`: a visual indication to the user informing the amount or size of disk.
        *   `transfer`: a visual indication to the user informing the amount of data transfer allowed per month for this server.
        *   `dollars_per_hr`: a visual indication to the user informing the cost of running this server per hour.
        *   `dollars_per_mo`: a visual indication to the user informing the cost of running this server per month.

Simplified example using a single plan with only 2 server sizes:

```json
[
  {
    "id":    "sfo1",
    "name":  "San Francisco 1",
    "plans": [
      {
        "id": "standard",
        "name": "Standard Configuration",
        "specs": [
          {"id": "512mb", "ram": 512, "cpu": 1, "disk": 20, "transfer": 1.0, "dollars_per_hr": 0.00744, "dollars_per_mo": 5.0},
          {"id": "1gb", "ram": 1024, "cpu": 1, "disk": 30, "transfer": 2.0, "dollars_per_hr": 0.01488, "dollars_per_mo": 10.0}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]

```

----
##### Verify the Account Credentials
The `/verify` route is used to verify a user's account credentials. The `credential_fields` specified in the metadata will be provided in the dashboard and required to be filled before the user can use this provider. After the credentials are provided, Nanobox will call this route to verify that the account credentials provided by the user are valid.

###### Path:
`/verify`

###### Method:
POST

###### Headers:
*   `Auth-` prefixed credential field keys and their corresponding values as populated by the user. This provides the necessary values to authorize the user within the provider.

Example:

```
Auth-Access-Token: 123abc
```

Note that this header requirement is shared by all endpoints. Further examples would look essentially identical, and have therefore been omitted.

###### Body:
empty

###### Response:
**On Success:** Should return an empty body with a `200` response code.

**On Failure:** Should return a json body with an `errors` node and a non 2xx status code.

Example:

```json
{
  "errors": [
    "Invalid Access Token"
  ]
}
```

Note that this failure response is shared by all endpoints. Further examples would look essentially identical, and have therefore been omitted.

----
#### SSH Key Management Endpoints

----
##### Create SSH Key
The `/keys` route is used to authorize Nanobox with the user's account that will be ordering servers. After ordering a server, Nanobox needs to SSH into the server to provision it. Nanobox will pre-generate an SSH key for the user's account and the authorization route allows Nanobox to register the key with the user's account on the provider so Nanobox can access the server after it is ordered.

*NOTE*: This route is **not** required if your provider uses passwords for SSH instead of SSH keys, assuming the Install Server Key endpoint is implemented instead.

###### Path:
`/keys`

###### Method:
POST

###### Headers:
*   `Auth-` prefixed credential field keys and their corresponding values as populated by the user. This will provide the necessary values to authorize the user within this provider.

###### Body:
*   `id`: the user-friendly name of the key.
*   `key`: the public key to register with the user's account. It is assumed that this public key will be installed on every server launched by this integration.

Example:

```json
{
  "id":  "nanobox-provider-account-ID",
  "key": "CONTENTS OF PUBLIC KEY"
}
```

###### Response:
**On Success:** Should return a `201` code with the following json data:
*   `id`: fingerprint or key identifier to use when ordering servers

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "provider-key-ID"
}
```

**On Failure:** Should return a json body with an `errors` node and a non 2xx status code.

----
##### Query SSH Key
The `GET /keys/:id` route is used by Nanobox to query the existence of previously created key.

*NOTE*: This route is **not** required if your provider uses passwords for SSH instead of SSH keys, assuming the Install Server Key endpoint is implemented instead.

###### Path:
`/keys/:id`

###### Method:
GET

###### Headers:
*   `Auth-` prefixed credential field keys and their corresponding values as populated by the user. This will provide the necessary values to authorize the user within this provider.

###### Body:
empty

###### Response:
**On Success:** Should return a `201` code with the following json data:

*   `id`: fingerprint or key identifier to use when ordering servers
*   `name`: the user-friendly name of the key.
*   `public_key`: "CONTENTS OF PUBLIC KEY"

Example:

```json
{
  "id": "provider-key-ID",
  "name": "nanobox-provider-account-ID",
  "public_key": "CONTENTS OF PUBLIC KEY"
}
```

**On Failure:** Should return a json body with an `errors` node and a non 2xx status code.

----
##### Delete SSH Key
The `DELETE /keys/:id` route is used to cancel a key that was previously created via Nanobox.

*NOTE*: This route is **not** required if your provider uses passwords for SSH instead of SSH keys, assuming the Install Server Key endpoint is implemented instead.

###### Path:
`/keys/:id`

###### Method:
DELETE

empty

###### Response:
**On Success:** Should return an empty body with a status code of `200`

**On Failure:** Should return a json body with an `errors` node and a non 2xx status code.

----
#### Server Management Endpoints

----
##### Order Server
The `/servers` route is how Nanobox submits a request to order a new server. This route **SHOULD NOT** hold open the request until the server is ready. The request should return immediately once the order has been submitted with an identifier that Nanobox can use to followup on the order status.

###### Path:
`/servers`

###### Method:
POST

###### Headers:
*   `Auth-` prefixed credential field keys and their corresponding values as populated by the user. This will provide the necessary values to authorize the user within this provider.
